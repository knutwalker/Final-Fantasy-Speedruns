\begin{battle}[32000]{Evrae}
    Turns in this fight can be a bit random at times - Treat each character independantly of each other, doing their action as their turn comes up.
    The important parts of this fight are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \rikku\ must do her \od\ before \tidus\ starts attacking
        \item \tidus\ only needs to be healed after the first attack
        \blitzballdetermination[true]{}{%
        \item \rikku\ or \kimahri\ must Lunar Curtain \tidus\ before Poison Breath
        }
    \end{enumerate}
